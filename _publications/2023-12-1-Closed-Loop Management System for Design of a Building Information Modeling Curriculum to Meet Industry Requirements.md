Building Information Modeling (BIM) has been one of the most significant and widely adopted advanced technologies in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry in recent years. Unfortunately, the current BIM curriculum in colleges does not adequately prepare students for real-world AEC industry practices. Besides, numerous concerns regarding the competency requirements of the AEC industry for BIM practitioners and the targeted design of teaching content of BIM curricula, etc. remain unanswered. To enhance the preparation of BIM students for real-world AEC work, this study collected 280 questionnaires from 27 administrative regions in China and conducted data analysis to assess the disparity between the competency requirements in the AEC industry and the existing BIM curriculum in colleges. Additionally, this study presents innovative theories, namely directed closed-loop and undirected closed-loop theories, derived from the closed-loop management system. These theories are effectively integrated into college BIM education as project closed-loop and content closed-loop theories. It validates the effectiveness of the curriculum design through BIM students’ academic performance. Results demonstrate that the closed-loop management design of the BIM curriculum can better match the AEC industry’s competency requirements and that BIM students will better adapt to real world AEC work.
